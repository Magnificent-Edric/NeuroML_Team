## Problem statement
The project focuses on generating plausible masks for brain pathology. The main goal is to develop a model that, given a healthy brain MRI scan, generates a mask indicating the plausible shape and size of where a specific pathology could theoretically occur in the scan. These masks will then be used to generate pathologies within healthy brain scans, thereby augmenting the dataset for training pathology segmentation models. The project aims to compare different mask generation strategies based on the segmentation scores of models trained on the augmented dataset. The technique can help make segmentation models more accurate, thus aiding in the automation of pathology detection.

## Methods && Results 
Our idea was consist at three main points(figure 3):
1. Train 3D segmentation model on patches with lesion mask in the center;

2. Given a patch of healthy MRI the model will generate a mask in the center analogous to seen on the train;

3. Additional conditioning on grey/white matter maps can be done.
